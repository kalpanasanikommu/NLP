Sexual reproduction involves taking half the genes of one parent and half of the\\nother, adding a very small amount of random mutation, and combining them to produce an\\noﬀspring. The asexual alternative is to create an oﬀspring with a slightly mutated copy of\\nthe parent’s genes. It seems plausible that asexual reproduction should be a better way to\\noptimize individual ﬁtness because a good set of genes that have come to work well together\\ncan be passed on directly to the oﬀspring. On the other hand, sexual reproduction is likely\\nto break up these co-adapted sets of genes, especially if these sets are large and, intuitively,\\nthis should decrease the ﬁtness of organisms that have already evolved complicated co-\\nadaptations. However, sexual reproduction is the way most advanced organisms evolved.\\n'>\n",
      "<LTTextBoxHorizontal(4) 90.000,279.149,522.006,493.296 'One possible explanation for the superiority of sexual reproduction is that, over the long\\nterm, the criterion for natural selection may not be individual ﬁtness but rather mix-ability\\nof genes. The ability of a set of genes to be able to work well with another random set of\\ngenes makes them more robust. Since a gene cannot rely on a large set of partners to be\\npresent at all times, it must learn to do something useful on its own or in collaboration with\\na small number of other genes. According to this theory, the role of sexual reproduction\\nis not just to allow useful new genes to spread throughout the population, but also to\\nfacilitate this process by reducing complex co-adaptations that would reduce the chance of\\na new gene improving the ﬁtness of an individual. Similarly, each hidden unit in a neural\\nnetwork trained with dropout must learn to work with a randomly chosen sample of other\\nunits. This should make each hidden unit more robust and drive it towards creating useful\\nfeatures on its own without relying on other hidden units to correct its mistakes. However,\\nthe hidden units within a layer will still learn to do diﬀerent things from each other. One\\nmight imagine that the net would become robust against dropout by making many copies\\nof each hidden unit, but this is a poor solution for exactly the same reason as replica codes\\nare a poor way to deal with a noisy channel.\\n'>\n",

The central idea of dropout is to take a large model that overﬁts easily and repeatedly\\nsample and train smaller sub-models from it. RBMs easily ﬁt into this framework. We de-\\nveloped Dropout RBMs and empirically showed that they have certain desirable properties.\\nOne of the drawbacks of dropout is that it increases training time. A dropout network\\ntypically takes 2-3 times longer to train than a standard neural network of the same ar-\\nchitecture. A major cause of this increase is that the parameter updates are very noisy.\\nEach training case eﬀectively tries to train a diﬀerent random architecture. Therefore, the\\ngradients that are being computed are not gradients of the ﬁnal architecture that will be\\nused at test time. Therefore, it is not surprising that training takes a long time. However,\\nit is likely that this stochasticity prevents overﬁtting. This creates a trade-oﬀ between over-\\nﬁtting and training time. With more training time, one can use high dropout and suﬀer less\\noverﬁtting. However, one way to obtain some of the beneﬁts of dropout without stochas-\\nticity is to marginalize the noise to obtain a regularizer that does the same thing as the\\ndropout procedure, in expectation. We showed that for linear regression this regularizer is\\na modiﬁed form of L2 regularization. For more complicated models, it is not obvious how to\\nobtain an equivalent regularizer. Speeding up dropout is an interesting direction for future\\nwork.\\n'>\n",

      "At test time, it is not feasible to explicitly average the predictions from exponentially\n",

      "the distribution used to drop units at training time) is the same as the actual output at\n",
      "test time. By doing this scaling, 2n networks with shared weights can be combined into\n",
      "a single neural network to be used at test time. We found that training a network with\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Motivation\n",
      "\n",
      "A motivation for dropout comes from a theory of the role of sex in evolution (Livnat et al.,\n",
      "2010). Sexual reproduction involves taking half the genes of one parent and half of the\n",
      "other, adding a very small amount of random mutation, and combining them to produce an\n",
      "oﬀspring. The asexual alternative is to create an oﬀspring with a slightly mutated copy of\n",
      "the parent’s genes. It seems plausible that asexual reproduction should be a better way to\n",
      "optimize individual ﬁtness because a good set of genes that have come to work well together\n",
      "can be passed on directly to the oﬀspring. On the other hand, sexual reproduction is likely\n",
      "to break up these co-adapted sets of genes, especially if these sets are large and, intuitively,\n",
      "this should decrease the ﬁtness of organisms that have already evolved complicated co-\n",
      "adaptations. However, sexual reproduction is the way most advanced organisms evolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "One possible explanation for the superiority of sexual reproduction is that, over the long\n",
      "term, the criterion for natural selection may not be individual ﬁtness but rather mix-ability\n",
      "of genes. The ability of a set of genes to be able to work well with another random set of\n",
      "genes makes them more robust. Since a gene cannot rely on a large set of partners to be\n",
      "present at all times, it must learn to do something useful on its own or in collaboration with\n",
      "a small number of other genes. According to this theory, the role of sexual reproduction\n",
      "is not just to allow useful new genes to spread throughout the population, but also to\n",
      "facilitate this process by reducing complex co-adaptations that would reduce the chance of\n",
      "a new gene improving the ﬁtness of an individual. Similarly, each hidden unit in a neural\n",

      "This idea can be extended to Restricted Boltzmann Machines and other graphical mod-\n",

      "veloped Dropout RBMs and empirically showed that they have certain desirable properties.\n",
      "One of the drawbacks of dropout is that it increases training time. A dropout network\n",
      "typically takes 2-3 times longer to train than a standard neural network of the same ar-\n",
      "chitecture. A major cause of this increase is that the parameter updates are very noisy.\n",
      "Each training case eﬀectively tries to train a diﬀerent random architecture. Therefore, the\n",
